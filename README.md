Recipe Data Pipeline

A complete pipeline for managing recipe data using Firebase Emulator, ETL scripts, and analytics. Converts raw JSON data into clean CSVs, validates data, and generates insights.

This project demonstrates a recipe data pipeline:

1. Extracts data from Firebase Emulator (users, recipes, interactions)

2. Transforms and normalizes data

3. Performs data quality validation

4. Generates CSV files for analysis

5. Provides analytics and insights on recipes and user interactions

Primary dataset includes Aditi’s Uttapam recipe and synthetic recipes for testing.
